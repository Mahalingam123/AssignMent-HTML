            Hello, my name is Mahalingam.
            I am from Tirunelveli. I am currently learning Java programming and building
            my skills step by step. Java has helped me understand the concepts of object-oriented
            programming, problem-solving, and logical thinking in software development.
            Along with Java, I am also learning HTML and CSS to improve my knowledge in web development.
            By combining these skills, I am gaining a
            strong foundation in both backend logic and frontend design.
            I am very passionate about programming and always eager to learn new concepts.
            My goal is to become a skilled developer, apply my knowledge in real-world projects, and continue improving
            myself in the field of software development.
